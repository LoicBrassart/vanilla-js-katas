"The ones that forge are the ones that become a blacksmith", says the proverb. 

Here you will have to repeat these exercises until they feel **natural** to you.

Once a day, redo all the exercises on which you do not feel completely confortable. 

At lunch break, in the evening when you get home, anytime, but choose a niche in your day and do them again until you know them inside out.

The sets of exercises are numbered, the solutions are in the same folder. **Read them!**.

This is not an Algorithm exercise strictly speaking, but an exercise in mastering the basic structures of language. 

Quickly you will be able to do the exercises without the solution; 

Then you will code them without really thinking about it. 

When finish them all, you can say that you really know the syntax of these exercises.

Within this series, you will find a new readme.md per folder which will give you the instructions to test your code, the concepts to know, the tools to install or the advice to approach the exercises.
